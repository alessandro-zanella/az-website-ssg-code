## Introduction:

This lesson introduces the fundamental concept of 'Clave' in salsa music, a musical structure that is essential for building melodies and rhythm patterns. Understanding Clave is crucial for dancers to create and perform choreographies effectively.

## Understanding Musical Bars in Salsa

- **Definition of a Musical Bar**: In salsa, a musical bar consists of four beats.
- **Subdivision of Beats**: These four beats can be subdivided further. For example, counting can be done as "1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &" or "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8".

## The Concept of Clave

- **Clave Figure**: A rhythmic pattern that is fundamental in salsa music.
- **Structure**: It consists of five strokes divided into a 'Question' (three strokes) and an 'Answer' (two strokes).
- **Counting for Dancers**: Dancers usually count in eight beats (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8), which can be split into two parts for the Clave rhythm.

## The 3-2 and 2-3 Clave Patterns

- **3-2 Clave Pattern**:
  - The 'Question' part (three strokes) falls on beats 1, the offbeat between 2 and 3 (2.5), and beat 4.
  - The 'Answer' part (two strokes) is on beats 6 and 7.
- **2-3 Clave Pattern**:
  - This is a reverse of the 3-2 pattern.
  - The 'Answer' part comes first, with strokes on beats 2 and 3.
  - The 'Question' part follows on beats 5, 6.5, and 8.

## Practical Tips for Dancers

- **Understanding Off Beats**: It's important for dancers to practice and understand off beats, as it adds a different feeling to the music.
- **Counting and Feeling the Rhythm**: While social dancing doesn't require active counting, it's beneficial during practice to understand the rhythm structure.

## Conclusion

Understanding the Clave is essential for salsa dancers to align their movements with the rhythm of the music. This lesson provides a basic foundation, with more detailed exploration available in further lessons.
